### 2.3 Modules and Components

#### Main Process
- **main.js**: Initialize and manage application lifecycle.
- **database.js**: Handle all database-related operations.
- **encryption.js**: Provide encryption services using AES-256.
- **security.js**: Manage security policies and features.

#### Renderer Process
- **pages**: Defined for each main interface (e.g., Dashboard, Vault).
- **components**: Reusable UI components for consistent design.
- **utils**: Shared utility functions across the renderer.
- **styles**: SCSS/CSS files for theming and styling.

## 3. Database Design

### 3.1 Schema Overview

#### Users Table
- **id**: Primary key identifier.
- **username**: Unique user identifier.
- **master_password_hash**: Securely stored master password hash.
- **salt**: Unique salt for password hashing.

#### Passwords Table
- **id**: Primary key identifier.
- **user_id**: Associated user.
- **title, username, password_encrypted, url, notes_encrypted**: Primary fields for password entry.
- **category, tags, strength_score**: Additional metadata.

#### Generation History Table
- **id**: Primary key.
- **user_id**: Associated user.
- **password_length, character_types, strength_score**: Logging of generation parameters.

#### Settings Table
- **id**: Primary key.
- **user_id**: Associated user.
- **key, value**: Configuration settings.

## 4. User Interface Design

### 4.1 Design Principles
- Clean and minimalistic aesthetic.
- High contrast and readability.
- Consistent iconography and color scheme.
- Responsive layouts for varying window sizes.

### 4.2 Key Screens
- **Welcome/Setup Screen**: First-time user setup and onboarding.
- **Master Password Authentication**: Secure user login.
- **Main Dashboard**: Overview of recent activities and quick actions.
- **Password Generator**: Customizable password generation interface.
- **Password Vault**: Secure storage and organization of passwords.
- **Settings & Preferences**: User-configured settings area.

### 4.3 Interaction Flow

1. **First Launch**: Set up master password to initiate encryption settings.
2. **Main Dashboard**: Quick access to generation and stored passwords.
3. **Password Vault**: Organized storage with search and filter capabilities.
4. **Generation Settings**: Adjust generation parameters to user preferences.
5. **Security Center**: View and manage strength analysis and recommendations.

## 5. Security Design

### 5.1 Security Context
- **Master Password**: Strong hashing with Argon2, serving as a key for encryption.
- **Data Encryption**: AES-256 for all sensitive data stored locally.
- **Secure Clipboard**: Automatic clearing of clipboard data after use.

### 5.2 Zero-Knowledge Architecture
- User master password never stored.
- All data encrypted at rest and in motion.
- Secure memory management practices.

### 5.3 Threat Mitigation
- Regular audits of cryptographic implementations.
- Secure random number generation.
- Enforce strong input validation across inputs.

## 6. Compliance and Standards

### 6.1 Accessibility Standards
- Ensure WCAG 2.1 compliance.
- Implement keyboard navigation and screen reader support.

### 6.2 Security Standards
- Follow OWASP top 10 guidelines.
- Implement robust data protection measures.
