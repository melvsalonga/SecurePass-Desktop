# SecurePass Desktop - Solo Developer Quick Start Guide

## ðŸš€ Getting Started (Solo Developer)

Since you're working solo, here's a streamlined approach to get you up and running quickly:

### Phase 1: Foundation (Week 1-2)
**Your Priority**: Get the basic structure working first

#### Day 1-2: Environment Setup
```bash
# Initialize your project
npm init -y
npm install --save electron
npm install --save-dev electron-builder webpack babel-loader @babel/core @babel/preset-env
```

#### Day 3-5: Basic App Structure
- Create main process (`src/main/main.js`)
- Set up renderer process (`src/renderer/index.html`)
- Basic window management
- Simple IPC communication

#### Day 6-8: Database Foundation
- SQLite setup with `better-sqlite3`
- Basic schema creation
- Simple CRUD operations

### Phase 2: Core Features (Week 3-4)
**Your Priority**: Make it functional

#### Week 3: Password Generation
- Start with basic random password generation
- Add character set options
- Simple UI for generation

#### Week 4: Strength Analysis
- Basic entropy calculation
- Simple strength meter
- Pattern detection (start simple)

### Phase 3: Security (Week 5-6)
**Your Priority**: Make it secure

#### Week 5: Encryption
- AES-256 implementation
- Argon2 password hashing
- Key management

#### Week 6: Master Password & Storage
- Master password setup
- Encrypted storage
- Authentication flow

## ðŸŽ¯ Solo Developer Tips

### 1. **Start Small, Build Incrementally**
- Don't try to implement everything at once
- Get basic functionality working first
- Add complexity gradually

### 2. **Focus on Core Features First**
- Password generation
- Basic storage
- Security (encryption)
- Polish comes later

### 3. **Use Proven Libraries**
- `electron` for desktop app
- `better-sqlite3` for database
- `crypto` (Node.js built-in) for encryption
- `argon2` for password hashing

### 4. **Testing Strategy for Solo Dev**
- Write tests for critical security components
- Manual testing for UI/UX
- Start with unit tests for core logic

### 5. **Time Management**
- Work in 2-hour focused blocks
- Take breaks to avoid burnout
- Set realistic daily goals
